# Kha Voxel Engine
A simple voxel engine made with Kha and Haxe.

## Features 

 - Connectivity with a world which shared a single world amongst multiple clients.
 - Cross-platform (included both HTML5 WebGL and native targets) thanks to the use of Kha and Haxe.
 - Hidden face culling.
 - Vertex colour based ambient occlusion based on [this excellent article](https://0fps.net/2013/07/03/ambient-occlusion-for-minecraft-like-worlds/).
 - Simple AABB collisions and arcade physics (double jumping!)
 - 'Infinite' (within reason of Int32's) worlds that are chunked in every axis (no height restrictions).
